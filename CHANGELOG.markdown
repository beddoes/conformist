# CHANGELOG

## 0.0.2

* Column#values_in will be nil if the index is out of range rather than an empty string. This is consistent with CSV
* Fixed 1.8.7 and JRuby dependancies. Gemspec will not let you specify dependancies based on the version of Ruby. Everyone gets it

## 0.0.1 / 2011-04-27

* Initial release
